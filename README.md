Default config for ALMN40 based on Polarity Works CRBN

# Build Guide
**NOTE**
* The top pin on the switch that goes above the USB-C port must be clipped because of the height tolerance!
* The bottom three diodes must be soldered on the underside of the PCB because of the height tolerance!

## Soldering PCB
### 1. Optional - Mill-Max Hot Swap Sockets
Press Mill-Max Hot Swap Sockets tightly into each switch pin hole

Tape the top of each row with electrical tape and solder the underside

I am using Mill-Max 3305-0-15-80-47-27-10-0

### 2. Diodes
* **Ensure the polarity of the diodes is correct before soldering!**
* **The three bottom diodes must be soldered on the underside of the PCB, otherwise they will hit the switches!**

Bend the diode pins along the edge of the PCB

Insert diodes into PCB, then tape the top of each row with electrical tape, then clip the pins on the underside and solder.

### 3. PCB Header Pins
* **Do not solder the Nice! Nano yet if you are not using hot swap sockets**

Insert the header pins such that the shorter pins go into the PCB, and solder the header pins to the PCB. The Nice! Nano can be inserted and oriented so that the chip and logo are no longer visible for alignment, but DO NOT solder it yet, otherwise the switches will be blocked from soldering.

### 4. Optional - Rotary Encoder
Solder the Rotary Encoder and clip the pins

### 5. Switches and Plate
* **The switch pin directly above the USB-C port must be clipped!**

Clip one switch pin for the switch above the USB-C port, and insert the switches into the plate and PCB. Solder the switches if you are not using hot swap sockets.
![Switch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7244488/187102925-4780b92d-b6ae-43fe-8960-e5e5593ae57d.jpg)

### 6. Battery Wires
* **The red wire goes on the positive (+) terminal!**
* **The wires should be inserted from the side where the chips are visible with the Nice! Nano logo!**

Solder the battery wires so that they can be tucked in between the Nice! Nano and the PCB later.

### 7. Nice! Nano
* **The Nice! Nano must be oriented so that the chips with the Nice! Nano logo face inside toward the PCB! They should not be visible.**

Insert the Nice! Nano into the longer bottom header pins oriented so that the logo and chips are no longer visible and tuck in the battery wires in between the Nice! Nano and the PCB.
![Nice! Nano](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7244488/187103008-0b34dbe0-68cd-4e9c-9e3d-9220b9658601.jpg)

Clip the bottom pins so that they are flush with the Nice! Nano, then solder the header pins to the Nice! Nano.

### 8. Battery
* **Make sure the red wire plugs into the red wire!**

Knot the excess battery cable, and plug it in as shown.

The cables coming out of the controller should be taut against the end of the controller so that they don't hit the edge of the battery cavity in the case.

Tape the battery to the case

### 9. Case
Drop the PCB into the case, ensuring that the battery wires are tucked neatly into the battery cavity, and the USB-C port on the Nice! Nano is aligned with the opening in the case. Assemble the case with screws.

### 10. Keycaps
Add keycaps and enjoy your new ALMN40!
